# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis
This program uses different sorting algorithms (Insertion Sort, Merge sort, Quicksort, Heapsort) to  sort 2 kinds of input:
1. N number if **unordered** and randomly generated integers. 
2. N number of **ordered** set of integers.

After sorting the input set, the efficiency of each algorithms are measured by their elapsed time from
